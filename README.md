**O'Day**, codename EmmaCD, is one of my iOS apps. Written in Swift 2.0. The whole GPU magic is run by a separate framework of mine, called Viewmorphic. I'm keeping Viewmorphic private for the time being. Most of the assets and some third-party frameworks are omitted as well. License: Proprietary. The promotional material for the App Store can be found in the PDF.
